# Discoverability
PFIs can become publicly discoverable by advertising their API endpoint as a [Service](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services) within their DID Document. In order to increase the likelihood of being discovered The `service` entry **SHOULD** include the following properties:

| Property          | Value                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | see [DID-CORE spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services)                               |
| `type`            | `PFI`                                                                                       |
| `serviceEndpoint` | PFI's publicly addressable API endpoint or DID which has PFIs publicly addressable endpoint |
If the serviceEndpoint is itself a DID, this DID should resolve to a document and then its serviceEndpoints can be examined for the `PFI` type entry. The ID can be chosen at the discretion of the PFI, but the service entry should be of type `PFI`.

## Example
```json
{
  "id": "did:example:pfi",
  "service": [{
    "id":"my-pfi",
    "type": "PFI",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://pfi.organization.com"
  }]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> _Decentralized_ discoverability is dependent upon whether the underlying [verifiable registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry) of the selected [DID Method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods) is crawlable

# Error Responses
* An error response is one whose status code is `>= 400`.
* If present, the body of an error response will conform to the following:

## Error response structure
| Field     | Type          | Required | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `message` | String        | Y        | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. |
| `details` | ErrorDetail[] | N        | Optional array of `ErrorDetail` objects                                  |

## ErrorDetail structure
| Field     | Type   | Required | Description                                                                            |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | String | N        | Optional server-generated request-specific ID, useful for diagnosing unexpected errors |
| `message` | String | N        | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.               |
| `path`    | String | N        | Path where validation failed (i.e. JSON schema path)                                   |

---

## Example
```json
{
  "message": "Missing field: payin.amount",
  "details": [{ 
    "id": "9af2bf88-e4f4-4f81-8ba9-55eaeeb718e2",
    "message": "Payin amount must be present.",
    "path": "$.payin.amount" 
  }]
}
```

# Exceptions
Custom exceptions are thrown in many scenarios as a way to provide more narrow and detailed information when the client encounters an error. 

| Exception                           | Description                                                                                                     | Typescript | Kotlin | Rust | Swift |

# Query Params
Query parameters, also known as query strings, are a way to send additional information to the server as part of a URL. They allow clients to provide specific input or customize the server's response. Query parameters typically follow the main URL and start with a `?` character. They consist of key-value pairs, and multiple pairs can be separated by `&` characters

Query params are supported by many of the `GET /${resource}` endpoints in the following ways

* Simple Example: `?simple=field`
* Same Field; Multiple Values: `field=value&field=anotherValue`

## Pagination
Pagination is supported using the following query params:

| Param          | Description                                                                 | Default |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `page[offset]` | Specifies the starting position from where the records should be retrieved. | `0`     |
| `page[limit]`  | Specifies the maximum number of records to be retrieved.                    | `10`    |

### Example
`/?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10`

---

# Idempotency
The IDs of individual tbDEX messages are used as idempotency keys

---

# Callbacks
Callbacks are implemented via the `replyTo` property on the [request to create an exchange](#create-exchange). 

`replyTo` is a fully qualified URI which could either be a DID or just a URL.

If `replyTo` is present, a PFI will send any/all new messages for a given exchange to the supplied URI. This makes the URI scoped to each exchange, allowing the caller to specify a different URI per exchange if they so wish. 

If `replyTo` is _not_ present, the caller will have to poll the PFI for the exchange in question to receive new messages.

---

# Protected Endpoints

A  **_protected endpoint_** is defined as one that requires the requester to be _authenticated_.  These endpoints respond with resources specific to the authenticated DID e.g. 
* Messages sent by or intended for the requester only
* Balances 

> [!NOTE] 
> Each individual endpoint section in this specification will include `Protected: true/false` to indicate whether it is protected

## Authentication

When accessing a protected endpoint, a tbdex http client MUST set the HTTP [Authorization Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) in order to be authenticated. 

The value of the header MUST use the Bearer Authentication Scheme as defined in [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.1), and the access token MUST be a JWT.

### Token Generation

The bearer token is a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) generated by the requester. It must consist of JWT header and Claims Set containing the below fields, and signed using the verification method published as the authentication verification relationship in the requester's DID document.

#### Header

| Key                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`typ`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-5.1)   | JWT. Setting `typ` to `JWT` as recommended by the JWT spec provides a means to disambiguate among different types of signatures and tokens.                                                     |
| [`kid`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.4) | Fully qualified [VerificationMethod ID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-methods). Used to locate the DID Document verification method utilized to verify the integrity of the JWT. |
| [`alg`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.1) | Cryptographic algorithm used to compute the JWT signature.                                                                                                                                      |


#### Claims Set

| Key                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`aud`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) | The intended PFI's DID. Incorporating the `aud` claim limits the risk to just one PFI in case a request token is compromised, thereby reducing the surface area for misuse. |
| [`iss`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1) | The requester's DID. Included to be informative, though it is technically duplicative as the `kid` also includes the requester's DID.                                       |
| [`exp`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) | Expiration timestamp. Limits the amount of time a compromised request token can be used.                                                                                    |
| [`iat`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6) | Indicates when the JWT was created. Included to be informative.                                                                                                             |
| [`jti`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7) | Used as a nonce to prevent replay attacks. The specification text should include more detail on how to prevent these attacks.                                               |

> [!NOTE]
> This bearer token is sufficient for authentication as it proves that the requester controls the private key associated to the DID that the requester is identifying as. 


## Token Verification

The receiver of the token must evaluate it to ensure its validity. A bearer token is valid if these conditions are met:

- `exp` timestamp is not in the past
- `aud` is the DID of the receiving PFI's DID
- `kid` is resolved to be a valid DID whose DID Document verification method is used to verify the integrity of the JWT
- `jti` is not a nonce that was previously used by the same requester
